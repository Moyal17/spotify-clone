## Full Stack Spotify Clone: A Next.js, React, Typescript & Supabase Project

### Description:
In this project, I undertook the creation of a comprehensive music streaming application from the ground up, mirroring the beloved features and functionalities of Spotify. Leveraging Next.js 13.4 and React, I developed an immersive, responsive, and dynamic user interface that closely emulates Spotify's sleek design. By harnessing the flexibility of Tailwind CSS, I achieved a visually stunning result, paying meticulous attention to every detail of the UI.

To power the backend, I employed Supabase, an open-source alternative to Firebase, built on PostgreSQL. This choice facilitated the creation of a robust foundation for the application. I meticulously established the Supabase project, designed database schemas, and seamlessly implemented authentication processes to ensure a secure user registration and login system.

### Work Duration: 6 days
